# TALK TO WEBSITE

pretty much exactly what the title says, 

## Installation
add your openai api key in the popup.js file and just load unpacked extension works with only chrome for now will be adding different browsers when i feel like coding again

## Disclaimer
this was a half hour project i made because i was bored ik i could have turned the extracted text to vector etc etc but i didn't feel like it also the extension frontend is bad because frontend sucks
